# Data-Visualisation
 I have used Seaborn which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.Easiest way to install seaborn is to use pip.
 ## Libraries used
 The libraries used here are pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn.To import random numbers and apply visulisation to them numpy.randm library is used it imports the random values, the number of values we need we have to state in advance.
