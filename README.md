# Data-Visualisation
 I have used Seaborn which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.Easiest way to install seaborn is to use pip.
 ## Libraries used
 The libraries used here are pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn.To import random numbers and apply visulisation to them numpy.randm library is used it imports the random values, the number of values we need we have to state in advance.

## Visualisation Techniques
The visualisation technique to be used depends upon the variables, no of variables, and information we want to extract from the raw data. Incase of single variable the techniques used are:- 1)Dotchart 2)Barplot 3)Histogram.
The visualisation technique for multiple variables are:-1)Heat map 2)Boxplot 3)Violin Plot 4)Regression.
